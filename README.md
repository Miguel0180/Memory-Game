# Memory-Game
A small Project of a Memory Game.
## Description

### Login
This project features a classic memory card game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game starts with a login page where the player's name is captured and stored in the browser's local storage. The stored name is then used throughout the game to personalize the experience.

### Game
The game consists of eight different cards, each duplicated to create pairs. When the player clicks on a card, it flips to reveal a symbol. The JavaScript logic checks if the player has selected two cards and then verifies whether the cards match. If the cards match, they remain visible; if not, they flip back over. A counter tracks the number of attempts made by the player to finish the game.

## Conclusion
This memory game project combines a simple yet engaging gameplay experience with a personalized touch through user login. By storing the player's name in local storage, the game offers a more tailored experience each time it is played. The implementation of basic game mechanics, such as card matching and move counting, provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and learning opportunities in web development.
